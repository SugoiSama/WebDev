            <p>Mental health refers to a person's emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act, and plays a crucial role in how we handle stress, relate to others, and make decisions. In this article, we explore the different aspects of mental health, common disorders, and the importance of seeking help when needed.</p>
            
            <h2>What is Mental Health?</h2>
            <p>Mental health encompasses a range of conditions and is influenced by various factors, including biology, life experiences, and family history. Good mental health allows individuals to realize their full potential, cope with the stresses of life, work productively, and contribute to their community.</p>

            <h2>Common Mental Health Disorders</h2>
